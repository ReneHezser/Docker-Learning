# Add a Database
Wordpress needs a database.

![Error establishing a database connection](/assets/no-database-connection.png)

That means we need to run e.g., MySQL in a container, that can be used by the Wordpress container.

1. Start a MySQL container and
    - supply the needed database connection information (check with the previously created custom image)
    - mount a folder

    <details><summary>command</summary>

    ```bash
    docker run --name mysql -d -e MYSQL_USER=wpuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=super-secret-password -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wpsite -e MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes -v /mnt/docker/mysql:/var/lib/mysql  mysql:8.0.30
    ```
    </details>

**Questions**
- Why is it not a good practice to run a container like this?
- How can the database be accessed? I don't see port mappings.
- Can you reach/ping the database from within the Wordpress container

## fix the connection

2. use docker commands to find out about the IP addresses the two containers are using

      ```bash
      docker inspect wordpress
      docker inspect mysql
      ```
    </details>

3. fix the wordpress container to be able to find the database
    - by changing the IP in the Dockerfile
    - or by overriding the IP in the run command

      ```bash
      docker run --name wordpress -d -p 8080:80 -e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=172.17.0.3:3306 myregistry/wordpress:1.0.0
      ```
      >Note the additional -e flag, which sets the environment variable.
