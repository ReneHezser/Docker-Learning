# Multi-Architecture images
You may have noticed that you did not need to specify an architecture, when you run an image. Docker can do that for you, if the used image supports multiple architectures.

1. Read https://docs.docker.com/desktop/multi-arch/
2. Create a multi arch image according to the docker documentation
