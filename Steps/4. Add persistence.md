# Add persistence to the application
When we started the MySQL container, we mapped a folder from the host into the container. The volume defined in the Dockerfile creates persistence. But you need to know the volume and attach it to a new instance of a container to have the content available in a new container.

1. Read [Use volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) and attach a volume to the Wordpress image
    <details><summary>commands</summary>
    Create a volume

    ```bash
    docker volume create wordpress-vol
    ```

    Recreate the Wordpress container and attach the volume

    ```bash
    docker run --name wordpress -d -p 8080:80 -e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=172.17.0.3:3306 -v wordpress-vol:/var/www/html myregistry/wordpress:1.0.0
    ```
</details>

2. Customize the blog. Add a new theme (download and activate from within Wordpress)
3. Remove the container and recreate it with the command used earlier. Is the content and the customization still there? Why?
