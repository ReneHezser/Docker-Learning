# Container Orchestrators
Multiple containers can be deployed together with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). In a Yaml file you define all the options containers need to run and communicate with other containers.

In order to scale workload to multiple servers, an orchestrator is needed. This could be Docker Swarm [What is Docker Swarm](https://programatically.com/orchestration-what-is-docker-swarm/), Kubernetes or other orchestrators. With multiple hosts load balancing and higher availability can be achieved.

Let's create a docker compose file to deploy the above applications.
- Two Wordpress instances
- One database
Docker Compose is installed automatically with Docker Desktop. If you are using a different platform, please [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

> Your app's network is given a name based on the "project name", which is based on the name of the directory it lives in. You can override the project name with either the --project-name flag or the COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME environment variable.

You probably need to install docker-compose first. Use e.g. apt ```sudo apt install docker-compose```.

Start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose -f .\compose.yaml -p app up -d 
```
