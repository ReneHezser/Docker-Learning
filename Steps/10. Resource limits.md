# Resource limits
Specifying the allowed resources a container can leverage from the overall available cpu and memory on the host is a good practice. If a container overuses resources, this can affect other processes on the host and be an indicator for "something is wrong" within the container.

Docker does not contain self-healing mechanisms besides [restart policies](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/start-containers-automatically/), but Kubernetes does. Containers behaving awkward are removed and recreated. For this to be possible, the orchestrator needs to know about the maximal resources a container may use.

Consult [Runtime options with Memory, CPUs and GPUs](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/) and start a container with individual limits.
