# Swap the custom Wordpress image with the official one
We built the first image to see how to modify existing images. Now that we know how to do it, let's swap the custom image with the official one without loosing the content of the site.

<details><summary>commands</summary>

1. Stop and remove the custom image based container of Wordpress
2. Start a new container, based on the official image
    ```bash
    docker run --name wordpress -d -p 8080:80 -e WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=mysql:3306 -e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=wpuser -e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=super-secret-password -e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=wpsite -e WORDPRESS_TABLE_PREFIX=wp_ --network=app-network -v wordpress-vol:/var/www/html wordpress:6.0.1-apache
    ```
</details>

**Questions**
- Why did we not loose the content?
- Why did we need to specify more environment variables?
