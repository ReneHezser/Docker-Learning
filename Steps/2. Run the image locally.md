# Running the image locally
The image has been built, and we are ready to run it locally (as it has not been published to a container registry).

1. Start a container based on your image. The app should be available on port 8080.
    <details><summary>command</summary>

    ```bash
    docker run --name wordpress -d -p 8080:80 myregistry/wordpress:1.0.0
    ```
    </details>
2. Check if it is running with ```docker ps``` 
3. Open a browser and check if the site is accessible

**Questions**
- What happens if you omit the tag (1.0.0) trying to run the container? And why?
- How can I remove the container?
